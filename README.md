Admission years between 2006-2022
Diagnostic codes originate from a predefined set, but there are actually 1000+ so perhaps the random alphanumeric combination is fine for now
Age_group is provided in ranges of 3 years (and I know you made a note about <18 for consumption, so left as was)
Ambulance indicator as ['G', 'N'] (G for Ground)
'HELMET_INDICATOR' and 'SEATBELT_INDICATOR' - possible ['Y', 'N', ""] fields
